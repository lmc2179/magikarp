# magikarp
exact and approximate solvers for NP Complete problems in python

![travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/lmc2179/magikarp.svg?branch=master)

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface to solvers for NP complete problems, particularly [Karp's list of 21 NP Complete problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karp%27s_21_NP-complete_problems).

Documentation pages for each problem are coming soon! For now, interested users can get solvers from the following modules:
* Partition problem - partition.py
* Travelling salesman problem - tsp.py
* Knapsack problem - knapsack.py
